# Optimizing scheduling heuristics for accelerated architectures

All of the main classes and functions can be found in `src.py`. The directories contain the scripts used to generate results and analyze them (e.g., make plots).  

## Navigation

`autopsy` : The autopsy method.

`chapter4` : Schedule graphs for Chapter 4 (see directory for that chapter).

`chol_graphs` : Cholesky factorization task DAGs saved using `dill`. (Not feasible to do likewise for STG.) 

`selection` : Processor selection rules.

`priorities` : Task prioritization methods.

`src.py` : Main file containing all the classes and functions used by the various scripts.
