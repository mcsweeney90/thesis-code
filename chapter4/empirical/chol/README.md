`generate.py` : Generate the empirical longest path distributions. 

`timing.py` : Time taken to generate distributions (timed separately for various reasons but maybe should have combined with above). 

`timing.csv` : Timing data produced by `timing.py`. 

`npaths.py` : Summarize the number of distinct longest paths that were observed.

`npaths.csv` : Saved data for above.

`nb128s1`, `nb128s4`, `nb1024s1`, `nb1024s4` : Directories containing empirical longest path data and analysis for Cholesky graphs with the indicated parameter choices.
