# Predicting schedule length under uncertainty.

All of the main classes and functions can be found in `src.py`. The directories contain the scripts used to generate results and analyze them (e.g., make plots).  

## Navigation

`clt` : Evaluation of existing heuristics based on the Central Limit Theorem (e.g., CorLCA) for Cholesky graphs. 

`empirical` : Generating and studying empirical longest path distributions for Cholesky graphs. 

`chol_graphs` : Cholesky factorization task DAGs.

`rpm` : Evaluating the Reduce Paths, then Maximize (RPM) framework for Cholesky graphs.

`stg` : All of the above repeated for the STG set. 

`src.py` : Main file containing all the classes and functions used by the various scripts.
